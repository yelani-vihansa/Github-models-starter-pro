/**
 * ASSESSMENT TASK - MULTI-TURN CODING ASSISTANT CHATBOT
 * 
 * This file serves as the main assignment for creating a sophisticated coding assistant
 * chatbot using the GPT-4o model through GitHub's AI inference API.
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * Create a multi-turn conversational chatbot that provides meaningful coding guidance
 * and assistance to developers. The chatbot should maintain conversation context
 * across multiple exchanges and provide helpful, accurate coding advice.
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:
 * 1. Environment Setup:
 *    - Load environment variables using the `dotenv` package
 *    - Initialize the OpenAI API client with GitHub token authentication
 *    - Configure the endpoint to use GitHub's AI inference service
 * 
 * 2. Multi-turn Conversation Logic:
 *    - Implement a conversation loop that maintains context
 *    - Store conversation history to preserve context across exchanges
 *    - Handle user input and AI responses in a continuous dialogue
 * 
 * 3. Coding Assistance Features:
 *    - Provide meaningful coding guidance based on user queries
 *    - Support various programming languages and concepts
 *    - Offer code examples, explanations, and best practices
 *    - Handle debugging help and code review suggestions
 * 
 * EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:
 * User: "How do I create a function in JavaScript?"
 * Bot: "You can create a function using the `function` keyword or as an arrow function. Here's an example: ..."
 * 
 * User: "Can you help me debug this code?"
 * Bot: "I'd be happy to help debug your code. Please share the code and describe the issue you're experiencing..."
 * 
 * TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * - Use the OpenAI SDK with GitHub's models endpoint
 * - Implement proper error handling for API calls
 * - Consider user experience with clear prompts and responses
 * - Maintain conversation state throughout the session
 * - Allow graceful exit from the conversation

// Assessment Task
// Create a multi-turn chatbot for coding assistance using the GPT-4o model.
// Use the `openai` package and implement the chatbot in this file.

// Steps:
// 1. Load environment variables using `dotenv`.
// 2. Initialize the OpenAI API with the GitHub token.
// 3. Implement a multi-turn conversation logic.
// 4. Provide meaningful coding guidance based on user queries.

// Example:
// User: "How do I create a function in JavaScript?"
// Bot: "You can create a function using the `function` keyword or as an arrow function. Here's an example: ..."







/**
 * MULTI-TURN CONVERSATIONAL CHATBOT
 * 
 * This file demonstrates how to create an interactive chatbot that maintains conversation context
 * across multiple exchanges. The application:
 * 1. Sets up a readline interface for user input/output
 * 2. Maintains a conversation history array to preserve context
 * 3. Continuously loops to accept user input and provide AI responses
 * 4. Allows users to exit the conversation by typing "exit"
 * 
 * Key concepts demonstrated:
 * - Persistent conversation memory using message arrays
 * - Interactive command-line interface with readline
 * - Asynchronous conversation loops
 * - Context preservation across multiple API calls
 * - Graceful exit handling
 * 
 * This shows how to build chatbots that can maintain coherent, contextual conversations
 * rather than treating each interaction as isolated.
